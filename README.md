# Equilibrium
OpenGL + SFML based game, works on the concept of Equilibrium.

# Objective
The main objective is to rest the particle in equilibrium state inside the 'target' partcile for a specific time, after that the level changes and the target gets reduced and so on.

# Controls
Use arrow keys to control the gravity by means of increasing mass of the 'walls' of the container.  
Every single key press adds a 10,000 units in the mass of that specific wall.

# Requirements
OpenGL  
SFML
